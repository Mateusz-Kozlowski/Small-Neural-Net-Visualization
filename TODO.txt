- add visual layer of desired outputs
- add rendering labels using a font

- pure virtual neuronalLayer class or sth like that
- why there was a bug? 
	wrong input coping?
	initializing vars in classes?
	that weird way of adding double?
	go the entire code and find more candidates
- convolutional nn?
